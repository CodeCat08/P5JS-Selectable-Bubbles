# P5JS-Selectable-Bubbles
This program allows the user to place "bubbles" on the canvas by "clicking and dragging" while their cursor is situated on the canvas. Once "bubbles" are placed on the canvas, the user can select which ones to delete by hovering their cursor over the "bubble" so that it's highlighted and selecting it with their primary mouse button. The goal of this program is to demonstrate the removal of objects from an array using the "splice" method.
